# Software

## Docker

The course comes with a handy [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kayceesrk/cs3100_iitm) which contains the
necessary software to run OCaml, SWI-Prolog and the Jupyter notebooks, primarily
through which the course is taught. Docker is a free software and is supported
on all major platforms. The installation instructions for Docker is available
[here](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). The instructions
for running the Jupyter notebooks is
[here](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_f19).

## OCaml

OCaml installation instructions are covered in the [Real World OCaml
book](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html). I would recommend installing
OPAM (OCaml Package Manager) with instructions from the [opam
website](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) and switching to OCaml version
4.07.1.

## SWI-Prolog

SWI-Prolog installation instructions are [here](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
