The aim of the course is to teach you about the different paradigms of
programming, their underlying concepts, and the relationships between them. We
will mostly look at functional and logic programming, touching upon imperative
programming concepts as we go through the course. We will study functional
paradigm through [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and logic paradigm through Prolog
(specifically [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)). The official course
description is [here](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/course_details.php?arg=MTk=).

The course will be primarily taught through interactive [Jupyter
Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). The instructions for setting up the notebooks
is found [here](/resources).
